# Stock-Web-Scraping-
Web scrape on stock data and indeed job happiness rating 
The objective of this project is to provide instant access to multiple stock data. 


Motivation

I found most of the time, the stock feature on the phone is not the best way to search for stock information.
I love browsing stocks, I often have multiple stocks on the mind to check, and stocks feature on the phone
or google each ticker and compare them are not very useful, and not a productive way to visualize them. I
also want to see what other factors might be useful for my research. Therefore, I added Indeed (Job
Search/Company review Website) and news website to it. The goal is to provide a deeper and more
thorough picture of the stock tickers.
