# Investment-Portfolio-Visualization-and-recommendation
*Python*
*Data Visualization, Web Scraping, data analysis, APIs.*


For this project, I picked Yahoo Finance as my main data source. The purpose of this project is to extract data (utilize API and web-scraping) from live sources and present the results. As a result, I build an user interactive investment program. 

Download the requirements.txt file and have it installed on your PC.

## What is the Stock Price? 
After you start the program, you will be prompt to enter the tickers of the stocks you are interested in. 
Test Result:
