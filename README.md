# Investment-Portfolio-Visualization-and-recommendation
*Python*
*Data Visualization, Web Scraping, data analysis, APIs.*


For this project, I picked Yahoo Finance as my main data source. The purpose of this project is to extract data (utilize API and web-scraping) from live sources and present the results. As a result, I build an user interactive investment program. Related News and Workplace ratings will be extracted to support the analysis. 

Download the requirements.txt file and have it installed on your PC.

## What is the Stock Price? 
After you start the program, you will be prompt to enter the tickers of the stocks you are interested in. 
Test Result:
> Which stock do you want to look into today?(Please enter a valid Ticker Symbol, enter done to proceed to next section <br />
> tsla <br />
> TSLA Current Price: 2,049.98 Fifty-Two weeks low: 211.54  Fifty-Two weeks high:2,095.49 <br />

You can enter as many you want

> Which stock do you want to look into today?(Please enter a valid Ticker Symbol, enter done to proceed to next section <br />

> BA Current Price: 167.50 Fifty-Two weeks low: 89.00  Fifty-Two weeks high:391.00 <br />

## Some Visualization
I found interactive plot more accurately depict stock price. I mainly used Matplotlib.
